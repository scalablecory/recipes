# Golden Butter Toffee

This crunchy, buttery toffee is rich in caramelized flavor and shatters beautifully into bits. Perfect on its own, coated in chocolate and nuts, or mixed into [cookies](Brown%20Butter%20Salted%20Chocolate%20Toffee%20Cookies.md).

## Ingredients

- 200g (1 cup) granulated sugar
- 120g (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
- 60g (3 tbsp) light corn syrup (or golden syrup for a richer flavor)
- 30ml (2 tbsp) water
- 1.5g (1/4 tsp) fine sea salt
- 2.5ml (1/2 tsp) vanilla extract

### Tools

- Heavy-bottomed 1.5 qt (1.4 L) steel saucepan
- Candy thermometer
- Heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon
- Parchment paper
- 15x10-inch (38x25 cm) baking sheet

A pan with a large mass that is capable of even heating is best. Multi-ply pans with copper layers help.

> **⚠** Burning may result in a pan scorched with burnt sugar. Avoid pans with non-stick coatings.

## Preparation

Once the ingredients heat up, the process moves quickly and is easy to mess up. Preparation is key.

- Set aside a candy thermometer. Prepare to place it into the saucepan, where its tip should rest securely *not* touching the bottom or sides of the pan.
- Measure the vanilla and set aside.
- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

### Combine Ingredients

Cut the butter into smaller pieces for more even melting. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar, butter, corn syrup, water, and salt.

No further ingredients will be used.

##  Cook the Toffee

1. Place the pan over medium heat and stir constantly until the butter is melted, the sugar dissolves, and finally it begins to bubble.

2. Securely attach the candy thermometer to the saucepan, making sure that the tip is within the mixture but does *not* touch the bottom or sides of the pan.

3. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the mixture reaches 300°F (150°C).

    > **⚠** Watch closely to prevent burning. Tilt the pan gently to move the mixture around, and use a spatula to occasionally scrape the bottom as it approaches 270-300°F. Be extra careful with electric stoves that have intermittent heating.

4. Once the toffee reaches 300°F (150°C), immediately remove the saucepan from heat.

5. Stir in the vanilla extract carefully (it may bubble up).

6. Once the vanilla is incorporated, pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet. Use a spatula as needed to spread the toffee to your desired thickness.

7. Let the toffee cool completely at room temperature (about 30-45min).

8. Once hardened, the toffee should easily lift from the parchment and shatter with a sharp impact or a little leverage. Place a towel over it to help contain pieces from flying around. Cheesecloth and plastic bags work well too.
