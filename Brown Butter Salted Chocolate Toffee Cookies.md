# Brown Butter Salted Chocolate Toffee Cookies

A gourmet twist on the classic chocolate chip cookie, these marry the nutty richness of browned butter with the sweet crunch of toffee bits and pockets of gooey melted chocolate. Perfectly balanced with a sprinkle of sea salt.

## Ingredients

- 226g (1 cup) unsalted butter
- 200g (1 cup, packed) light brown sugar
- 100g (1/2 cup) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs (100g total, about 50g each)
- 10g (2 tsp) vanilla extract
- 320g (2 2/3 cups) all-purpose flour
- 5g (1 tsp) baking soda
- 3g (1/2 tsp) fine sea salt

- 150g (1 cup) [toffee bits](Golden%20Butter%20Toffee.md), for mixing.
- 200g (1 1/4 cups) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks, for mixing.
- Flaky sea salt, for finishing

### Tools

- 1 QT (1L) saucepan
- Mixing bowls (small, medium, and large)
- Whisk and spatula
- Plastic wrap
- Parchment paper
- Baking sheets
- Wire racks

## Preparation

- In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the brown and white granulated sugars.
- In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and fine sea salt.

## Create the Cookie Dough

1. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.

2. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the butter foams, turns golden brown, and emits a nutty aroma (about 5-7 minutes).

3. Remove from heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl, ensuring all browned bits are included.

4. Let cool for 10 minutes.

5. To the cooled brown butter, add the light brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk until smooth and combined.

6. Mix in the eggs and vanilla extract until fully incorporated.

7. Gradually add the flour, baking soda, and sea salt to the wet mixture, stirring gently with a spatula or wooden spoon, until just combined.

    > **⚠** Do not over-stir the mixture, as this will develop gluten. You are making cookies not bread.

8. Fold in the toffee bits and chocolate chips/chunks until evenly distributed.

9. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours for enhanced flavor and texture.

## Bake the Cookies

### Prepare

- Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
- Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
- Measure sea salt and set aside for use after baking.

### Bake

1. Scoop 40g portions of dough (about 2 tablespoons each) and place them 5 cm apart on the prepared baking sheets.

2. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are set and lightly golden, but the centers remain slightly soft.

3. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

4. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
