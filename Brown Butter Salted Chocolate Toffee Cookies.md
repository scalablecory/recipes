## Ingredients

- 226g unsalted butter
- 200g light brown sugar
- 100g granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs (about 100g total)
- 2 tsp (10g) vanilla extract
- 320g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp (5g) baking soda
- 1/2 tsp (3g) fine sea salt

- 150g [toffee bits](Golden%20Butter%20Toffee.md), for mixing in.
- 200g semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks, for mixing in.
- Flaky sea salt, for finishing

### Tools

- Medium saucepan
- Mixing bowls (small, medium, and large)
- Whisk and spatula
- Plastic wrap
- Parchment paper
- Baking sheets
- Wire racks

## Preparation

- In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the brown and white granulated sugars.
- In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and fine sea salt.

## Create the Cookie Dough

1. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.

2. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the butter foams, turns golden brown, and emits a nutty aroma (about 5-7 minutes).

3. Remove from heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl, ensuring all browned bits are included.

4. Let cool for 10 minutes.

5. To the cooled brown butter, add the light brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk until smooth and combined.

6. Mix in the eggs and vanilla extract until fully incorporated.

7. Gradually add the flour, baking soda, and sea salt to the wet mixture, stirring gently with a spatula or wooden spoon, until just combined.

    > **âš ** Do not over-stir the mixture, as this will develop gluten. You are making cookies not bread.

8. Fold in the toffee bits and chocolate chips/chunks until evenly distributed.

9. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours for enhanced flavor and texture.

## Bake the Cookies

### Prepare

- Preheat oven to 350F (175C)
- Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
- Measure sea salt and set aside for use after baking.

### Bake

1. Scoop 40g portions of dough (about 2 tablespoons each) and place them 5 cm apart on the prepared baking sheets.

2. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are set and lightly golden, but the centers remain slightly soft.

3. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

4. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
